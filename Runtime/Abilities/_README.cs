	Automatic, which automatically fire bullets when holding down the shoot button and generally have large magazine sizes
	Semiautomatic, which can also fire by holding down the shoot button but generally fire faster by tapping it, and have small magazine sizes
	Charged, which need the fire button to be held for a short moment before the release of the projectile (some guns don't need to be charged to shoot, but the uncharged shots deal less damage)
	Beam, which are similar to Automatic, except they fire a continuous beam rather than individual bullets
	Burst, which work like Automatic or Semiautomatic, but fire multiple projectiles and consume multiple ammo in one shot
